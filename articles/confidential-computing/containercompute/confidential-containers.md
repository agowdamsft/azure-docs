# Confidential Containers

Enabled developers to bring an existing docker application (new or existing) applications and run it securely on AKS through confidential computing nodes support.

Executions of confidential container application in secure enclaves provide:

1. data integrity 
1. data confidentiality
1. code integrity
1. container code protection
1. hardware-based assurances
1. create hardware root of trust

A hardware based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an important component that is used to provide strong assurances through hardware and software measurements from Trusted computing case(TCB) components. Verifications of these measurement help with validation of the expected computation and verify any tampering of the container apps.

Confidential containers support customer applications developed with Python, Java, Node JS so on or packaged software applications like NGINX, Redis Cache, MemCache so on to be run unmodified on AKS.

Confidential containers are the fastest path to container confidentiality including the container protection through encryption, enabling lift and shift with no/minimal changes to your business logic.

## Confidential Container Enablers

To run an existing docker container application an abstraction layer or SGX software is required. The software enables the functionality for the container application to directly execute the process to CPU thus removing the middle execution layers.

Confidential containers are fully supported on AKS and enabled through Azure Partners and Open Source Software (OSS) projects. Developers can choose software providers based on the features.

### Partner Enablers

Support coming soon. 

### OSS Enablers 

#### Graphene
![Graphene Logo](./media/aks/graphenelogo.png)

Graphene is a lightweight guest OS, designed to run a single Linux application with minimal host requirements. Graphene can run applications in an isolated environment with benefits comparable to running a complete OS and has good tooling support for converting existing docker container application to Graphene Shielded Containers (GSC).

Get started with a sample application and deployment on AKS [here](https://graphene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cloud-deployment.html#azure-kubernetes-service-aks)

#### Occlum
![Occlum Logo](./media/aks/occlumlogo.png)

Occlum is a memory-safe, multi-process library OS (LibOS) for Intel SGX. It enables legacy applications to run on SGX with little to no modifications to source code. Occlum transparently protects the confidentiality of user workloads while allowing an easy lift and shift to existing docker applications.

Occlum supports AKS deployments. Follow the deployment instructions with various sample apps [here](https://github.com/occlum/occlum/blob/master/docs/azure_aks_deployment_guide.md)

#### Confidential Inferencing ONNX Runtime
Open source enclave-based ONNX runtime establishes a secure channel between the client and the inference service - ensuring the neither the request nor the response can leave the secure enclave. 

This solution allows you to bring existing ML trained model and run them confidentially while providing trust between the client and server through attestation and verifications. 

Get started with ML model lift and shift to ONNX runtime [here](https://aka.ms/confidentialinference)
